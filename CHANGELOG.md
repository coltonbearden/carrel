# Changelog

## v0.1.2 — 2026-09-04

Housekeeping release after the repository moved to `coltonbearden/carrel`.

- **Fixed:** the v0.1.1 wheel reported `carrel 0.1.0` — the release bumped
  `pyproject.toml` without bumping `product.json` (the source of truth). Version
  bumps now go through `product.json` + `scripts/sync_product.py`, which also
  syncs the marketplace/plugin manifests, `CITATION.cff`, and `[project.urls]`;
  `tests/test_product_sync.py` fails if any copy drifts.
- **Fixed:** `--json` is now accepted after the subcommand for every data
  command (`carrel pack --json …`), not only before it. `carrel watch --json`
  implies `--json-lines`.
- **Fixed:** external-tool timeouts surface as a clean error (exit 1 with the
  binary name) instead of a traceback; `watch` actions get `--action-timeout`
  (default 300 s) so a hung action can no longer wedge the watcher.
- **Fixed:** `index` exits 3 (not 0) when every file was skipped for a missing
  binary; `redact --fail-empty` prints why it exited 5.
- **Changed:** all links, badges, and `claude plugin marketplace add` targets
  point at `coltonbearden/carrel`; install hints use `uv tool install carrel`.
- **Changed:** dependencies bumped for security advisories (pypdf ≥ 6.16.1,
  mkdocs-material ≥ 9.7.7).
- **Fixed (review follow-ups):** `--json` also works after nested subcommands
  (`carrel tag ls … --json`); an unchanged `index` re-run stays exit 0 and
  `--update` hook mode never fails; per-file tool timeouts are recorded instead
  of aborting the walk; a timed-out `watch` action is killed as a whole process
  group; undecodable tool output can no longer crash `doctor`;
  `sync_product.py` escapes TOML strings and touches only plugin versions;
  the publish workflow requires the release commit to be on `main` and diffs
  every generated file.
- **Internal:** ruff + mypy gate in CI, SHA-pinned actions, split build/publish
  release workflow with tag↔version check and attestations, Dependabot config,
  `SECURITY.md`, `CODEOWNERS`, `py.typed`, pre-commit.
